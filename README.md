# Search directory's File Contents
Using this program you can search any given directories files contents,
this is useful in case you have multiple files and remember the line of code you are looking for but don't remember which file it is inside of.
# Simply enter the given data when prompted.
Directory, file extension, your desired search
So for instance, if we wanted to search our .java files for a comment like '//Bug' in directory C:\Users\name\programs, we would input the following:
# C:\Users\name\programs, .java, //Bug
# Currently Supported files
As of now directory_search.py can search through .java, .py, and .txt file extensions.
